# NEAR Horizon GitHub Organization

Welcome to the NEAR Horizon GitHub Organization, the collaborative hub for projects associated with NEAR Horizonâ€”an early-stage accelerator empowering Web3 founders to build, connect, and grow within the NEAR ecosystem.

## About NEAR Horizon

NEAR Horizon provides a platform for Web3 founders to access ecosystem experts, connect with fellow entrepreneurs, participate in accelerator programs, secure financial support, and attract investments.

## Key Repository: Horizon Monorepo

One of our primary repositories is the [Horizon Monorepo](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon), which encompasses all the services and code that constitute the Horizon product. This monorepo is structured into several directories, each with its own README file for detailed explanations. Key directories include:

- **aggregator**: Source code for aggregating and ingesting data from the blockchain into our database.
- **airtable-sync**: Code to update tables in Airtable for manual processing.
- **api**: Main backend for fetching data stored in our database.
- **app**: Frontend code for the Horizon website.
- **contract**: Main smart contract that powers the interactions and logic behind the product.
- **indexer**: Source code for our indexer, which listens to function calls sent to our smart contract and captures them in our database.

For a comprehensive overview of the directory structure and additional details, please refer to the [Horizon Monorepo README](https://github.com/near-horizon/horizon).
